# 6 DOF Robotics Arm
I am presenting my 6-axis robot arm project, which is the newest of my robotic projects. It has a very strong structure with its metal body and 13 kg.cm high torque servo actuators. It has mission software that can work fully autonomously. In addition, a modern (grisper) end-functioner was designed and included in the project instead of the classic gripper systems. The robot has successfully passed the circulating ball mission.
